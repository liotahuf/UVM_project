To do from last time:

-Try to connect the refMOdel to the UVM env and run the test - DONE ( run sanity check test on both)
- Build assettions to check APB protocol

To do (in general):
- adjust Makefile:
add a file which replace includes from Kmeans_test_tb.sv - to clean line added to run commands in makefile(probably to the VCS).

- run few more tests and brainstorm criterias for scoreboard comapre function behavior.
afterwards, implement compare function at scoreboard according to criterias.

- according to goel's advice on how to start the writing of the Project Book, start the documentation.
(might think by ourselfes what should be in there and in what order)

- brainstorm and write an initial Test Line (scenarios list):
1. find common scenarios for common system verilog problems.
2. creatively think on scenarios dedicated to our DUT.


Task for next week (split missions from To do section above):
Eddy:
- adjust Makefile:
add a file which replace includes from Kmeans_test_tb.sv - to clean line added to run commands in makefile(probably to the VCS).

Liora:
- according to goel's advice on how to start the writing of the Project Book, start the documentation.
(might think by ourselfes what should be in there and in what order)

Togheter:
- run few more tests and brainstorm criterias for scoreboard comapre function behavior.
afterwards, implement compare function at scoreboard according to criterias.

Questions:
1. how to use defines - they are not working as regular as they should.

on Hold:
- Build assettions to check APB protocol
- in sequncer make sure this is okay not writing both unpacked arrays to factory, which are in kmeans transaction class
- fix Defines in whole code.
