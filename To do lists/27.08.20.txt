To do from last time:

To do :

- Kick start reference model in matlab - Liora
- Kick start UVM modules - Edi
- Learn about Assertioning - Edi
- Learn how to integrate matlab code in UVM - Liora


What has benn done:
- Learn about Assertioning - Edi
- Handle gen of num-points - edi done
- Add driver handle interupt - probably need to posedge pready for requesting any read - cause before interupt read or write are blocked - Edi done

Task for next week:
- Learn how to integrate matlab code in UVM,:write questions about the instrcutions and send them to goel - Liora
- Try to make refModel in sv - Liora
- Kick star project report- Liora
we need to understand when to start and with what - probably should ask goel on tuseday about it - 1.9.20
-reorginize sequencer, kmeans_transaction, driver:
as discussed with goel today(27.8):
sequencer only make kmeans_transactions, send them to driver.
transaction contains 3 generated fields : 8 centorids, num points, data_points(according to just generated num points).
-in sequncer make sure this is okay not writing both unpacked arrays to factory, which are in kmeans transaction class
- should arrange SB part which accpets data from monitor_dut and hold 8 centroids.
Questions:
1. how to use defines - they are not working as regular as they should.
